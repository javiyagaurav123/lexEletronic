= Custom email engine/function =

If you don't want to send emails by `wp_mail()` you can do the following way:

	add_filter( 'notify_users_email_use_wp_mail', '__return_false' );

	function custom_email_engine( $emails, $subject, $message ) {
		// custom actions here!
	}

	add_action( 'notify_users_email_custom_mail_engine', 'custom_email_engine', 10, 3 );
