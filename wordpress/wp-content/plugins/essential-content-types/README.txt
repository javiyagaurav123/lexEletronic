== Description ==

**Essential Content Types** allows you to feature the impressive content through different content/post types on your website just the way you want it. These content/post types are missed by the themes in WordPress Theme Directory as the feature falls more towards the plugins' territory.

Content is at the forefront of any website. Changing the layout of your important content changes the way your website looks, which may not be a plus point if your current website layout is loved by your users.

Additionally, switching themes changes your website layout completely. Therefore, to keep things looking spic-and- span in your website, we bring you Essential Content.

Essential Content allows you to add up to three content/post types:
* Portfolio – Create and display your portfolio on your website
* Testimonials – Add customer testimonials to your website
* Featured Content – Display the content you want as featured content on your website to attract visitors' attention
* Services – Add your services on your website

Features of Essential Content:
* Enable/Disable any content/post type as needed
* Light-weight
* Supports all themes on WordPress

Essential Content is inspired by *Jetpack's Custom Content Types feature*.

However, not everyone wants to have a plugin that “does-it- all”. Some may want plugins to be niche focused and concentrate on smaller areas.

That is precisely what we have done with Essential Content. Essential content, true to its name, has only the essential elements. We have added the features that WordPressers use most. We have ruled out all other elements to make it non-bloated and clean. It takes up lesser space and does the job well.

If you think we have missed any essential content/post types, please let us know. We’ll review the frequency of usage and add your suggestions.
